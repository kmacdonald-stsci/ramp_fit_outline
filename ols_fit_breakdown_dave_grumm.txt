These are the suggestions

To further segregate related functions in ols_fit.py, here are some rough groupings of similar functions that you could consider moving into other modules. (This is just based on a quick review, and there is some overlap here - consider this just as a guideline):

Output model-related

def set_output_models( )
def create_output_models( )

OLS ramp fitting

def ols_ramp_fit_multi( )
def ols_ramp_fit_sliced()
def ols_ramp_fit_single()

JWST-specific

def discard_miri_groups( )

Slope fitting

def ramp_fit_slopes( )
def ramp_fit_compute_variances( )
def ramp_fit_overall( ) # needs epydoc description
def calc_slope( )

Perhaps move to utils.py

def calc_power(snr)
def interpolate_power(snr) # needs epydocs

Fitting particular segments/ramps

def fit_next_segment( )
def fit_lines( )
def fit_single_read( )
def fit_double_read( )
def fit_1_group( )
def fit_2_group( )
def calc_num_seg( )

Calculation of goodness-of-fit parameters

def calc_unwtd_fit( )
def calc_opt_fit( )
def calc_unwtd_sums( )
def calc_opt_sums( )
